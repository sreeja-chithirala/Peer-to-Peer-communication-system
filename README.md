# Peer-to-Peer-chatting
Peer to peer chatting between 2 systems

First run the  peer1.py program in the first system
Then run peer2.py program in the another system.

In the peer1.py program and peer2.py program, near the ip address it should be peer1 systems's ip address.

We need to make sure that ip address is checked before running the programs to avoid any errors.
